# YourChildhoodVault
 This is the place when you can archive your favorite movies, games, TV shows, and songs from your childhood.
You can add up to 5 items for each category, and once you're done, you can lock the vault to keep your memories safe.

* Please note: For optimal outcomes, aim to maintain a 2:3 aspect ratio for your photos, except for the song's album cover, which should be in a 1:1 aspect ratio
